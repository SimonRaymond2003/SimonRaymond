### Simon P. Raymond

For all my codes, I will try to follow similar patterns.

I use bootstrapping in all of my codes instead of k-fold-cv. While it creates more work as many functions have k-fold-cv built-in, I feel it is worth it as it is a more robust way of getting validation samples and allows me to make as many as I want.

For the initial train/val/test process, the train/val will be bootstrapped a number of times to ensure I'm getting a relatively representative display of what each hyperparameter actually is. Then, I will test the best average hyperparameter (based on some metric) on a set-aside test set. This entire process will repeat N times. 

XGB2 follows a more accurate realistic way of tuning which tests each hyperparmeter a large amount of times.

### Terminology that I use

* Train: This is the data that I "build" the model on. It is the data that the model "sees."

* Val: This is validation data that the model predicts upon that gives us results in terms of tuning hyperparameters.

* Test: This is the set-aside data that we evaluate our model upon.

* md/model_data: This is the combination of train and val data that we build our model on during the final "test" stage of the algorithm.

* AUC: Area under Curve.

* y: I will always make the predicted value y.

Titanic: For these examples, I am using the classic ML Titanic data to predict survivors.

### Content

Adaboost

it uses properly worked with titanic features, No parrallel processing it is just to give a super broad look.

Xgboost

I have two files.. One does more analysis and shows the data prep a bit better. The other appliies a more efficient algorithm.
it uses properly worked with titanic features

Nnet

it uses properly worked with titanic features, No parrallel processing it is just to give a super broad look.


LM RF and Cart

These features are not properly worked with as they are not as important. A better RF model is found in the importance of features section in xgboost. They do use Parrallel proccessing

### notes to myself

Make a seperate page for all my data. itll be cleaner
